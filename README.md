## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Build

To get the whole project with the correct folder structure use `git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:Emotion2Emoji-LMU-ACP-WS24-25/Docker-Compose.git [path]` with `path` being the optional custom path to clone the repo into.

`docker-compose up --build` : Brings up the whole stack including a persistent MongoDB Container, the "Middleware" (i.e. [`Backend-Interface`](https://github.com/Emotion2Emoji-LMU-ACP-WS24-25/Backend-Interface)) as well as the dependent VLM, LLM and Stable Diffusion (i.e. [`Backend-StableDiffusion`](https://github.com/Emotion2Emoji-LMU-ACP-WS24-25/Backend-StableDiffusion)) applications.

Use `-d` to run the docker-compose detached.

Expose backend port 3000 using ngrok with a static URL, following the instructions [here](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup/docker). Once set up, add the static URL to the .env file in the Flutter frontend. (See frontend README)

In the main directory, add a `.env` file as well.
1. **MODELS_PATH=VALUE**, the local path to the directory with all the downloaded model files
2. **API_KEY=VALUE**, the huggingface API key

For model download, use:
```
git lfs install
git clone git@hf.co:<MODEL ID> # example: git clone git@hf.co:google/paligemma2-3b-ft-docci-448
```
